# To-Do List Application

## Description

This is a **To-Do List** application built using **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. It allows users to add, update, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The app stores tasks in a MongoDB database, ensuring persistent data storage even after a page refresh.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can create new tasks with descriptions.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks once completed or no longer needed.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Tasks can be marked as completed for tracking.
- **Edit Tasks**: Users can edit existing task names or descriptions.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in a MongoDB database, so they persist across page reloads.
- **Responsive Design**: The application works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - **React**: For building the user interface.
  - **React Router**: For navigating between different views.
  - **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend.

- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
  - **Express.js**: Web framework for handling routes and HTTP requests.

- **Database**:
